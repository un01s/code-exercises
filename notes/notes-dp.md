# [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)

* optimal substructure (local optimal leading to global optimal)
* overlapping subproblems 

if a problem can be solved by combing optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called "divid and conquer" instead. This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems.

## some examples

### Dijkstra's algo for shortest path problem

### fibonacci sequence

### A type of balanced 0-1 matrix

### checkerboard

### sequence alignment

### tower of hanoi puzzle
