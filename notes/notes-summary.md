# Data Structures and Algorithms

The fundamental structures are ```array``` and ```linked list```. The basic operations on any data structure are as follows: 
 
| Operation | Array | Linked List |
| -- | ----- | ----------- |
| READ: access to one element | index | Traverse |
| WRITE: modify one element | index | Traverse |
| SEARCH: look for one specific element | index | Traverse |
| ADD: add one new element | resize | pointer |
| MINUS: remove one existing element | move | pointer |
