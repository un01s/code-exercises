# Data Structures and Algorithms

The fundamental structures are ```array``` and ```linked list```. The basic operations on any data structure are as follows: 
 
* access to one element (Read)

* modify one element (WRITE)

* look for one specific element (SEARCH)

* add one new element (ADD)

* remove one existing element (MINUS)

| OP | Array | Linked List |
| -- | ----- | ----------- |
| Read | index | Traverse |
| Write | index | Traverse |
| SEARCH | index | Traverse |
| ADD | resize | pointer |
| MINUS | move | pointer |
