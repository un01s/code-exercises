# Data Structure and Algorithm in C++

Go over basic data structures and algorithms. At the same time pick up the missing parts of C++, and other languages. Possible move to GPU, and embedded display?

The order of learning is to follow basic data structures and common algorithms based on them, and to implement the solutions of LeetCode questions in C++ and other languages.

## 05-string

## 06-double-pointer

## 07-stack and queue

## 08-binary tree

## 09-back tracking

## 10-greedy algorithm

## 11-dynamic programming 

## 12-graph
