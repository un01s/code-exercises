# Data Structure and Algorithm in C++

Go over basic data structures and algorithms. At the same time pick up the missing parts of C++, C, Go and JavaScript. Is it possible to move to GPU, especially embedded GPU or embedded display?

The order of learning is to follow basic data structures and their related common algorithms, and to implement the solutions of LeetCode questions in C++ and other languages.
